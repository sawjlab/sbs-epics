Edit the epicsEnvSet definition of "H" in st.cmd to change
the IP address of the Wiener Mpod crate.

Copy the file ../../mibs/WIENER-CRATE-MIB.txt to ~/.snmp/mibs.
The defintion of MIBDIRS in st.cmd should remove the need to do
this, but seems not to work.

To start the ioc from this directory execute the command
    ../../bin/linux-x86/<appname> st.cmd

Alternatively make the st.cmd file directly executable with
    chmod +x st.cmd
and check the executable name on the first line of the st.cmd file 

You may need to change the name of the .dbd file given in the
st.cmd's dbLoadDatabase() command before starting the ioc.
